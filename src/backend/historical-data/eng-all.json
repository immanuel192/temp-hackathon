A bit of background for those that don’t know, the MySQL 5.5 to 5.6 migration is not something thats easily rolled-back, hugely different performance profiles, not to mention the the myriad of highly tuned variables that we had to migration to AWS. For some of the older folk that remember our last attempt at this upgrade a few years ago, when our DB was doing 40K questions per second, resulted in 3 weeks of production impact, loss of sleep and lots of angry customers. So the fact that no one noticed this happened 2 days ago is testament to the work and planning that went into this.\n\nTo <@UBLPYR5T5>, <@U1VD9AA0L>, <@U1TA04R9U>, <!subteam^S66558BD2|@app_ops> and others who executed this, well done and thank you.

It’ll be held here in our offices in Sydney on Saturday 23 Nov.\n\nWe have Kai Haley, Google’s Head of Design Relations and the lead for their Design Sprint Master Academy headlining the event. Kai has deep expertise in UX and product development, particularly with large product suites. Google themselves use Design Sprints within their Android and Geo product teams, and Kai is able to draw on this to share her insights.\n\nAs well as Kai, we have Tom Richardson, APAC MD of InVision speaking (InVision will also be sharing their ‘Enterprise Design Sprint’ handbook), Loletta Cheng from Qantas and Bella Bain from IBM iX Studio (she is one of their design studio leads).\n\nIn addition we have a two part session from Global Virtual Sprint team. The first part is a live, online showcase from their currently active worldwide remote sprint with an update on their progress. In the second part they are going to outline the key steps in organising and running remote design sprints.\n\nIn the afternoon we will be running a hands-on, accelerated learning workshop around a curated Design Sprint Challenge, where small teams will run a ‘Sprint Jam’ mini-sprint; a fast paced sprint through the salient points of Design Sprints!\n\nFinally, we close the day with an ‘Ask Me Anything’ experts panel where you can directly hear from the key speakers their perspectives on any Design Sprint topic you choose.\n\nA full day packed with key learnings and insights into planning, organising and running successful Design Sprints.\n\nI’m happy to say we’ve acquired 6 tickets to give away to interested SiteMinder folk. For those interested, it’s first in best dressed – ping me a direct message asap to secure your spot!",

During the initial meeting we will be talking about some ground rules, organisation, storing meeting minutes, decision registries etc. Don’t be put off by this! Once we iron out the technicalities we’ll jump into technical discussions. It’s all about creating an environment for sharing knowledge, improving tooling and letting good ideas be heard. It’s for us to decide how we want to drive change.\n\nThe primary focus of the guild is the JVM ecosystem and how we work within it. Any JVM topic is welcome. Any JVM-related pain points the teams face are worth discussing - bring it all to the table! For any NOT JVM related discussions check other guilds, they’re out there!\n\nExamples of topics relevant to the guild:\n- HTTP testing library - discuss available tooling\n- Class and method naming conventions\n- Null-safety with Kotlin\n\nExamples of topics not relevant to the guild:\n- Testing approach in microservices\n- Component architecture e.g. usage of kinesis-to-api lambda\n\nBefore we agree on the agenda please post your ideas in `guild-java` channel which we can consolidate, group and discuss.\n\nOne more thing. What exists today (<https://github.com/siteminder-au/channels-documentation>, <https://github.com/siteminder-au/channelmanager-framework>, <https://github.com/siteminder-au/guild-java)> IS the standard. The guild is to discuss proposed changes to the standard following a procedure (RFC) which we’ll discuss and document as a guild.\n\nLastly, everyone’s welcome to come!",

(2c each)\n• Tell us what this item is in this picture  (7c each)\n• Draw bounding boxes around hands (10c each)\n\nIn our case we could use it for any time you’ll want to classify a large number of data manually, e.g. if we correctly scraped prices, names, address, room types, etc from an OTA, that would cost &lt;5c per page given the effort so you can get results from 35,000 hotels for under $2k.",

These are two very different things, yet even today many people are still confused by the conflation.\n```\n```\nSo what can teams do?\nThe best alternative is to think, not blindly follow someone else’s “best” practice. To connect your teams to customers and business-value generation directly. To focus on products, not projects, and create an environment in which the team is not just allowed but encouraged to adapt, try, fail, learn, and grow. No canned process can replace the wisdom of the team, or inject \"agility\" into a hostile and stagnant culture.\n```",
