There’s now a beta release of vue3 available: <https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next>\n\nPackage such as `vue-router`, `vue-test-utils` and a bunch of others are now in alpha, which a beta release around the corner. The general release date is still “sometime in 2020”… There’s definitely a lot more movement in the past week or so.\n\nFor anyone looking to try it out, they’ve released an experimental vue-cli plugin for adding vue3 support - <https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli-plugin-vue-next>\n\nYou can still try out the `@vue/composition-api` package to extend an existing Vue2 app, which is what CMTBB and a couple of the apps in Insights are using today.\n\nThe main difference between those two sneakpeak options is the shift to ES6 Proxy in Vue3 as opposed to the get/set approach in Vue 2.

One of those is the Vue Composition API which aims to solve some of the challenges in the existing Class and Object style APIs.\n\nThe development for the CM TBB project, which will replace the extranet UIs for The Channel Manager &amp; TheBookingButton, is due to finish its beta build phase around the same time as Vue. Myself and the team working on the project have been considering early adoption of the new API and have started weighting up the pros and cons.\n\nCM TBB is the precursor for SiteMinder’s Platform Vision and will eventually house most of our customer facing UIs.\n\nThere’s a running confluence doc which illustrates the findings of a POC to integrate the API: <https://siteminder.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CMTBB/pages/680004715/Vue+Composition+API>\n\nPlease take some time to read through this doc carefully and share your comments (preferably in the confluence doc).",

Good to see we finally finished the lolly bag :stuck_out_tongue: Some followup:\n\n- *Content Security Standards*: Please review the RFC here which includes a draft proposal. More work needs to be done but the implementation of the lambda is what I’m most interested in getting thoughts on <https://github.com/siteminder-au/guild-frontend/blob/content-security-standards/rfc/content-security-standards/readme.md#rd-proposal>\n- *Sputnik Tables*: <@U8NQ7CPBK> will be making tables great again. There’s now a ticket in the Sputnik backlog to create a sm-table-light (or similar) component which helps to solve a handful of the issues raised yesterday in this channel\n- *Frontend Tech Test RFC*: <@U8NQ7CPBK> and <@U5VK0H8S0> and working on an RFC which is reviewing our current frontend tech test. The comments from today’s meeting will be collated and next week we’ll aim to consider a proposal for what to change\n\nIf I missed anything, let me know. Thanks again. Happy Tuesday :thumbsup:",

Planning to wait on the progress of other RFCs which will feed into this\n- Internationalisation: Technical concept is working. Planning to finalise a rollout plan for next Thursday and verify the process with the translation team.\n- Adding a thread loader to the FE generator: Consensus reached. Requesting comment from the greater engineering team.\n- Upgrading element in Sputnik: Postponed for now due to bandwidth.\n- Adding frontend test examples to the generator: Planning to PR to the generator by next Thursday.\n\nWe’ve also discussed two new RFCs: browser compatibility standards and frontend interview guidelines.\n\nBig thanks for the input that’s gone into these so far. Awesome effort.",

In Sputnik’s documentation, the example works because the items are hardcoded.  If your product’s menu items are dynamic, then you will need to implement the `&lt;platform-header-dropdown&gt;` so that it does not render until you have compiled the full list of items before binding it to the component.\n\nOtherwise, el-dropdown will complain when resetting tab indices when arrow up/down or even when the dropdown loses focus.",
