    "text": "Just like so much, want to share:joy: \nThe following was written by the late Douglas Adams of \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" fame.\n\"Australia is a very confusing place, taking up a large amount of the bottom half of the planet. It is recognisable from orbit because of many unusual features, including what at first looks like an enormous bite taken out of its southern edge; a wall of sheer cliffs which plunge into the girting sea.\nGeologists assure us that this is simply an accident of geomorphology, but they still call it the \"Great Australian Bight\", proving that not only are they covering up a more frightening theory but they can't spell either.\nThe first of the confusing things about Australia is the status of the place. Where other landmasses and sovereign lands are classified as continent, island or country, Australia is considered all three.\nTypically, it is unique in this.\nThe second confusing thing about Australia is the animals. They can be divided into three categories: Poisonous, Odd, and Sheep. It is true that of the 10 most poisonous arachnids on the planet, Australia has 9 of them. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that of the 9 most poisonous arachnids, Australia has all of them.\nAny visitors should be careful to check inside boots (before putting them on), under toilet seats (before sitting down) and generally everywhere else.\nA stick is very useful for this task.\nThe last confusing thing about Australia is the inhabitants.\nA short history: Sometime around 40,000 years ago some people arrived in boats from the north. They ate all the available food, and a lot of them died.\nThe ones who survived learned respect for the balance of nature, man's proper place in the scheme of things, and spiders. They settled in and spent a lot of the intervening time making up strange stories.  They also discovered a stick that kept coming back.\nThen, around 200 years ago, Europeans arrived in boats from the north.\nMore accurately, European convicts were sent, with a few deranged people in charge. They tried to plant their crops in autumn (failing to take account of the reversal of the seasons), ate all their food, and a lot of them died.\nAbout then the sheep arrived, and have been treasured ever since. It is interesting to note here that the Europeans always consider themselves vastly superior to any other race they encounter, since they can lie, cheat, steal and litigate (marks of a civilised culture they say), whereas all the Aboriginals can do is happily survive being left in the middle of a vast red-hot desert - equipped with a stick.\nEventually, the new lot of people stopped being Europeans on 'extended holiday' and became Australians. The changes are subtle, but deep, caused by the mind-stretching expanses of nothingness and eerie quiet, where a person can sit perfectly still and look deep inside themselves to the core of their essence, their reasons for being, and the necessity of checking inside their boots every morning for fatal surprises. They also picked up the most finely tuned sense of irony in the world, and the Aboriginal gift for making up stories. Be warned.\nThere is also the matter of the beaches. Australian beaches are simply the nicest and best in the world, although anyone actually venturing into the sea will have to contend with sharks, stinging jellyfish, stonefish (a fish which sits on the bottom of the sea, pretends to be a rock and has venomous barbs sticking out of its back that will kill just from the pain) and surfboarders. However, watching a beach sunset is worth the risk.\nAs a result of all this hardship, dirt, thirst and wombats, you would expect Australians to be a sour lot. Instead, they are genial, jolly, cheerful and always willing to share a kind word with a stranger. Faced with insurmountable odds and impossible problems, they smile disarmingly and look for a stick. Major engineering feats have been performed with sheets of corrugated iron, string and mud.\nAlone of all the races on earth, they seem to be free from the 'Grass is greener on the other side of the fence' syndrome, and roundly proclaim that Australia is, in fact, the other side of that fence. They call the land \"Oz\" or \"Godzone\" (a verbal contraction of \"God's Own Country\"). The irritating thing about this is... they may be right.\nTIPS TO SURVIVING AUSTRALIA\nDon't ever put your hand down a hole for any reason - WHATSOEVER.\nThe beer is stronger than you think, regardless of how strong you think it is.\nAlways carry a stick.\nAir-conditioning is imperative.\nDo not attempt to use Australian slang unless you are a trained linguist and extremely good in a fist fight.\nWear thick socks.\nTake good maps. Stopping to ask directions only works when there are people nearby.\nIf you leave the urban areas, carry several litres of water with you at all times, or you will die. And don't forget a stick.\nEven in the most embellished stories told by Australians, there is always a core of truth that it is unwise to ignore.\nHOW TO IDENTIFY AUSTRALIANS\nThey pronounce Melbourne as \"Mel-bin\".\nThey think it makes perfect sense to decorate highways with large fibreglass bananas, prawns and sheep.\nThey think \"Woolloomooloo\" is a perfectly reasonable name for a place, that \"Wagga Wagga\" can be abbreviated to \"Wagga\", but \"Woy Woy\" can't be called \"Woy\".\nTheir hamburgers will contain beetroot. Apparently it's a must-have. How else do you get a stain on your shirt?\nThey don't think it's summer until the steering wheel is too hot to handle.\nThey believe that all train timetables are works of fiction.\nAnd they all carry a stick.\"",
